        shortDescription: "How coworking spaces in office buildings can enhance collaboration, flexibility, and cost-efficiency.",
        longDescription: `
        <p class="pt-4">As the nature of work continues to evolve, businesses are increasingly looking for innovative ways to optimize their office environments. One of the most effective strategies emerging in recent years is the integration of coworking spaces within traditional office buildings. This hybrid approach not only enhances productivity but also fosters collaboration, reduces costs, and provides greater flexibility for businesses of all sizes.

        In this article, we will explore the key benefits of incorporating coworking spaces into office buildings and why this model is poised to shape the future of work.</p>

        <p class="pt-4"><strong>Enhanced Collaboration and Networking</strong></p>
        <p class="pt-4">Coworking spaces thrive on the principles of community and collaboration. Unlike traditional office setups, these shared spaces bring together professionals from diverse backgrounds, industries, and skill sets. This melting pot of talent and expertise creates a fertile ground for networking, idea-sharing, and innovation.

        For businesses, having access to a dynamic environment where employees can interact with professionals from other fields can lead to new opportunities, fresh perspectives, and even potential partnerships. Startups can gain insights from seasoned entrepreneurs, freelancers can find new clients, and corporations can tap into a pool of creative minds. This cross-pollination of ideas is invaluable in today's fast-paced, innovation-driven economy.</p>

        <p class="pt-4"><strong>Cost Efficiency</strong></p>
        <p class="pt-4">Reducing operational expenses is a priority for businesses, especially startups and small enterprises with limited budgets. Integrating coworking spaces within office buildings allows companies to share resources such as office furniture, high-speed internet, meeting rooms, printing facilities, and administrative support.

        By utilizing a shared economy model, businesses can significantly lower overhead costs, freeing up funds to invest in core operations, employee development, or business expansion. Larger companies can also benefit by optimizing their office space, ensuring they are not paying for unused desks and underutilized areas.

        </p>

        <p class="pt-4"><strong>Flexibility and Scalability</strong></p>
        <p class="pt-4">The modern workforce demands flexibility, and businesses that fail to adapt risk losing talent. Coworking spaces offer unparalleled flexibility in terms of space utilization, allowing businesses to scale up or down based on their needs.

        For example, a startup experiencing rapid growth may require additional workspace for new hires but may not yet be in a position to commit to a long-term lease. Conversely, companies facing seasonal fluctuations can easily adjust their workspace requirements without financial strain. This adaptability ensures that businesses remain agile and responsive to market changes.

        Additionally, coworking spaces provide remote and hybrid work options, allowing employees to choose where and how they work most effectively. This level of autonomy can boost job satisfaction, productivity, and employee retention.</p>

        <p class="pt-4"><strong>Improved Work-Life Balance</strong></p>
        <p class="pt-4">Maintaining a healthy work-life balance is crucial for employee well-being and productivity. Unlike traditional offices, coworking spaces are designed to promote a harmonious blend of work and relaxation. Many coworking spaces incorporate elements such as breakout lounges, wellness rooms, meditation areas, and even fitness centers, encouraging employees to take necessary breaks and recharge.

        A well-structured coworking environment helps employees delineate work from personal life, reducing the risk of burnout. The presence of social events, community lunches, and networking meetups further adds to a sense of belonging and purpose, making work more enjoyable and fulfilling.</p>

        <p class="pt-4"><strong>Access to Professional Amenities</strong></p>
        <p class="pt-4">Another major advantage of integrating coworking spaces within office buildings is the access to high-quality amenities that may not be available in conventional office settings. Businesses operating in coworking environments often benefit from premium facilities such as:

        State-of-the-art meeting rooms equipped with video conferencing technology

        High-speed internet and IT support

        On-site cafes and dining areas

        Event spaces for workshops and seminars

        Concierge and reception services

        These amenities enhance professionalism, improve productivity, and contribute to a seamless work experience. Startups and small businesses, in particular, can leverage these facilities to create a more professional image when meeting with clients and investors.</p>

        <p class="pt-4"><strong>Why the Future of Work is Hybrid</strong></p>
        <p class="pt-4">The COVID-19 pandemic reshaped how businesses perceive office space. Remote work became the norm, and many employees discovered they could be just as productive—if not more—outside of traditional office settings. However, the lack of in-person interaction highlighted the importance of community, networking, and collaboration.

        By integrating coworking spaces within office buildings, businesses can offer a hybrid model that blends the best of both worlds: the flexibility of remote work and the collaborative energy of an office environment. This approach allows companies to attract top talent, foster innovation, and remain competitive in a rapidly changing landscape.</p>

        <p class="pt-4"><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
        <p class="pt-4">Incorporating coworking spaces into office buildings is more than just a trend; it's a strategic move that aligns with the evolving needs of businesses and employees alike. From fostering collaboration and reducing costs to offering flexibility and enhancing work-life balance, this model presents a win-win scenario for all stakeholders.

        As businesses continue to embrace hybrid work models, the demand for coworking spaces within office buildings will only grow. Organizations that recognize this shift early and adapt accordingly will be well-positioned for long-term success in the future of work.</p>

        longDescription: `
        <p class="pt-4"><strong>A Missing Piece in Vacancy Reports</strong></p>
        <p class="pt-4">After reviewing numerous reports on business premises vacancy rates in Croatia, one thing becomes clear: the overall vacancy rate has remained relatively stable for quite some time. However, what I found lacking in most of these reports is a closer look at two increasingly important metrics — the average deal size (i.e., rented square meters per lease) and the length of lease agreements. These data points offer valuable insight into how the office leasing market is truly evolving, especially in the era of flexible work and shifting tenant demands.</p>

        <p class="pt-4"><strong>How Flexible Office Leasing Has Evolved</strong></p>
        <p class="pt-4">Having spent the past 11 years immersed in the serviced office, flexible lease, or — more commonly known — coworking industry, I've witnessed firsthand how dramatically things have changed. When I first entered the market back in 2014, the typical inquiry we received was for a 9-month lease accommodating roughly 1.2 employees. Fast forward to today, and we're now averaging 3.1 people per inquiry with a standard lease term of 12 months.</p>

        <p class="pt-4"><strong>Conventional Leases Are Changing, Too</strong></p>
        <p class="pt-4">These shifts aren't limited to coworking alone. Conventional leases, which used to lock tenants in for 5+ years, are also being affected. The average square meterage per deal has significantly dropped compared to a decade ago. In a recent high-profile example, Meta (formerly Facebook) broke a 20-year lease agreement with a landlord in central London — and paid a staggering £142 million in penalties to exit early. This kind of move reflects a larger trend: corporate flexibility is no longer a perk, but a necessity.</p>

        <p class="pt-4"><strong>What Smaller, Shorter Deals Mean for Landlords</strong></p>
        <p class="pt-4">As a result, many landlords are now finding that the majority of incoming inquiries are for smaller spaces — typically no more than 250 square meters — and for significantly shorter terms, often not exceeding three years. But what does this mean for their business model?

        </p>

        <p class="pt-4"><strong>Operational Complexity Is the New Challenge</strong></p>
        <p class="pt-4">It means adaptation is no longer optional. While many landlords are beginning to recognize and respond to these changing demands by offering more flexible lease terms and subdividing larger spaces, doing so comes with increased complexity. Smaller deals mean higher tenant turnover and greater administrative load. To operate successfully under this new model, landlords must invest in robust back-office operations, technology platforms, and professional property management — all of which contribute to higher operational costs.</p>

        <p class="pt-4"><strong>Flexibility Must Be Supported by Structure</strong></p>
        <p class="pt-4">This is why it's critical that these transitions are done strategically and managed professionally. A well-structured approach can ensure profitability even within a landscape of smaller, shorter-term deals. Conversely, failing to adapt — or adapting inefficiently — can lead to operational strain, lost revenue, and empty buildings.</p>

        <p class="pt-4"><strong>Conclusion: The Future Belongs to the Prepared</strong></p>
        <p class="pt-4">The bottom line? Flexibility is the future, but only if it's backed by operational excellence. Landlords who embrace this shift with the right mindset, tools, and infrastructure will be best positioned to thrive in the new era of office leasing.</p>

        name: "5 Key Considerations When Creating Productive and Flexible Office Space",
        shortDescription: "When creating productive and flexible office space, there are five major areas that must be carefully considered: people, culture, space, technical requirements, and time frame.",
        longDescription: `
    <p class="pt-4"><strong>Creating Productive and Flexible Office Space</strong></p>
    <p class="pt-4">Designing and delivering an office that is both functional and adaptable requires balancing people's needs with business objectives, technical infrastructure, and project timelines. When creating productive and flexible office space, there are five core areas that must be considered: people, culture, space, technical requirements, and time frame.</p>

    <p class="pt-4"><strong>Define Goals and User Profiles</strong></p>
    <p class="pt-4">The starting point for any successful workplace is a clear understanding of who will use the space and how. Identifying primary activities such as deep focus work, light focus, collaboration, meetings, guest access, reception, and breaks is essential. Mapping occupant types and numbers, both current and projected, ensures that growth is supported. Finally, aligning the space with the company's brand, culture, and wellbeing targets helps create an environment where people feel engaged and supported.</p>

    <p class="pt-4"><strong>Space Planning and Layout</strong></p>
    <p class="pt-4">Careful planning of the layout ensures that every square meter works efficiently while supporting diverse work modes. This includes creating clear zones: quiet areas for focus, collaboration hubs, meeting rooms, social and amenity spaces, and operational support zones. Flexibility is key—modular furniture, movable partitions, and scalable technology allow the office to evolve. Circulation should be efficient, with unobstructed paths and reasonable walk times, while a dedicated technical core for power, data, and HVAC reduces clutter and simplifies future upgrades.</p>

    <p class="pt-4"><strong>Ergonomics and Furniture</strong></p>
    <p class="pt-4">Comfort and health are critical drivers of productivity. Adjustable chairs and desks, including sit-stand options, give employees control over their working posture. Workstations should provide sufficient depth and screen space, with proper keyboard and mouse clearance. Adequate storage solutions reduce clutter and keep work surfaces clean, contributing to both wellbeing and efficiency.</p>

    <p class="pt-4"><strong>Acoustics and Privacy</strong></p>
    <p class="pt-4">Noise is one of the most common frustrations in open-plan offices. Effective acoustic strategies include soft flooring, ceiling clouds, acoustic panels, and proper door seals. Phone booths and small meeting rooms should provide sound isolation and, if needed, sound masking systems. In open areas, spillover noise can be managed with perimeters, screens, or furniture-based separators, ensuring employees have access to quiet when they need it.</p>

    <p class="pt-4"><strong>Lighting and Daylight</strong></p>
    <p class="pt-4">Lighting plays a major role in wellbeing and focus. Offices should maximize natural light while controlling glare. Tunable, circadian-friendly lighting supports different times of day, while task lighting ensures detail-oriented work is comfortable. Smart controls and dimming options allow lighting to adapt to different work modes and occupancy levels, reducing both strain and energy use.</p>

    <p class="pt-4"><strong>Technology, Power, and Data</strong></p>
    <p class="pt-4">Technology should be seamless and reliable. Modern workplaces require strong Wi-Fi coverage throughout, abundant power and USB outlets, and simple cable management. Meeting rooms should include AV systems that are easy to book and operate, supporting hybrid collaboration. A dedicated IT and server space ensures infrastructure can scale with business growth while minimizing downtime.</p>

    <p class="pt-4"><strong>Accessibility and Safety</strong></p>
    <p class="pt-4">Inclusive design ensures the workplace works for everyone. This includes accessible routes, appropriate heights for work surfaces, clear signage, and accessible restrooms. Safety cannot be overlooked: fire compliance, clear egress routes, non-slip flooring, and edge protection are all essential. Materials should be durable and easy to maintain, reducing risks and upkeep costs.</p>

    <p class="pt-4"><strong>Materials, Finishes, and Sustainability</strong></p>
    <p class="pt-4">Sustainable choices create long-term value. Low-VOC paints and finishes improve air quality, while durable, easy-to-clean fabrics and surfaces simplify maintenance. Selecting recycled and eco-friendly materials reduces environmental impact, and energy-efficient systems contribute to both cost savings and corporate responsibility. Sustainability should be integrated into both design and operation.</p>

    <p class="pt-4"><strong>Privacy, Security, and Branding</strong></p>
    <p class="pt-4">Workplaces need to balance openness with discretion. Confidential meetings and tasks require visual and acoustic privacy. Data and physical security should be planned for sensitive areas. Branding—whether through colors, logos, or tactile wayfinding—should be visible but not overwhelming. When done correctly, branding strengthens culture and makes the space an extension of the organization's identity.</p>

    <p class="pt-4"><strong>Breaks, Social Spaces, and Amenities</strong></p>
    <p class="pt-4">Employees perform at their best when they also have space to recharge. Break areas and social spaces should feel comfortable and welcoming, encouraging informal connections. Kitchenettes and coffee points must be sized for peak usage and fitted with durable equipment. Adding natural elements like plants and wood textures—biophilic design—creates a sense of calm and contributes to wellbeing.</p>

    <p class="pt-4"><strong>Conclusion: The Future of Productive Offices</strong></p>
    <p class="pt-4">Designing a productive and flexible office is more than arranging desks—it is about creating an environment that supports people, culture, and growth while staying aligned with technical requirements and timelines. With over 20,000 sqm of office space equipped and delivered, we know that a well-designed office not only houses employees but empowers them to do their best work. The future belongs to offices that are adaptable, people-centric, and strategically planned.</p>

        shortDescription: "How purpose-built phone booths can improve focus, comfort, and productivity in open-plan offices.",
        longDescription: `
        <p class="pt-4">Open-plan office spaces are increasingly popular for promoting collaboration and flexibility. However, they come with a significant challenge: <strong>noise</strong>. Excessive noise can reduce focus, lower productivity, and increase stress among employees, making noise management a critical aspect of modern office design.</p>

        <p class="pt-4"><strong>Common Approaches to Noise Reduction</strong></p>
        <p class="pt-4">Many offices try to tackle noise using <strong>acoustic panels</strong>—wall-mounted, ceiling-mounted, or panels with integrated lighting. Others build small enclosed rooms or partitioned phone booths. While these solutions help, they often fall short: makeshift booths frequently suffer from <strong>poor insulation and inadequate ventilation</strong>, leaving spaces uncomfortable or unusable for longer calls or focused work.</p>

        <p class="pt-4"><strong>Why Ventilation and Insulation Matter</strong></p>
        <p class="pt-4">A private space is only effective if it provides both <strong>privacy and comfort</strong>. Without proper ventilation, air can become stale quickly. Without effective insulation, conversations can still be overheard, defeating the purpose of the space. Purpose-built phone booths solve these problems with materials and design tailored for office use.</p>

        <p class="pt-4"><strong>Benefits of Purpose-Built Phone Booths</strong></p>
        <ul class="pt-4 list-disc list-inside">
            <li><strong>Effective Soundproofing:</strong> Minimizes external noise and prevents internal sounds from escaping.</li>
            <li><strong>Integrated Ventilation:</strong> Maintains fresh air and a comfortable temperature for longer use.</li>
            <li><strong>Mobility and Flexibility:</strong> Freestanding booths can be moved or reconfigured as office layouts change.</li>
            <li><strong>Cost Efficiency:</strong> Often cheaper and faster than constructing permanent rooms, with minimal disruption.</li>
            <li><strong>Variety of Configurations:</strong> Available in single-person booths or larger units for small meetings.</li>
            <li><strong>Minimal Installation Disruption:</strong> Quick setup avoids interrupting daily office operations.</li>
        </ul>

        <p class="pt-4"><strong>Additional Tips for Noise Management</strong></p>
        <p class="pt-4">Phone booths work best as part of a broader noise management strategy:</p>
        <ul class="pt-4 list-disc list-inside">
            <li><strong>Zoning:</strong> Separate collaborative areas from focused work zones.</li>
            <li><strong>Acoustic panels:</strong> Combine booths with panels to reduce ambient noise.</li>
            <li><strong>Behavioral guidelines:</strong> Encourage employees to use booths for calls and focused work.</li>
            <li><strong>Maintenance:</strong> Regularly check ventilation systems and insulation for optimal performance.</li>
        </ul>

        <p class="pt-4"><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
        <p class="pt-4">Open-plan offices don't have to mean constant noise and distraction. Investing in <strong>purpose-built phone booths</strong> enhances productivity, comfort, and employee well-being. With proper insulation, integrated ventilation, flexibility, and smart design, phone booths provide a practical, cost-effective alternative to permanent rooms while fitting seamlessly into any office environment.</p>
